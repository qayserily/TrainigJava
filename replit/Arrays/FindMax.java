/*
Given an array **num**, get the max number in the array and print it out to the console.

```
nums → [2, 4, 2, 3, -2]) → 4
nums → [2, 2, 5, 3, 0 ]) → 5
nums → [1, 33, 5, 7, 9]) → 33
```

hint:

_create a variable called max and before you start searching assume the first item value is the max._

_loop through each and every item and check for whether the value max is less than the item value._

_if so assign the value to the max to overwrite existing max._

_you will get the max value when you are done with the loop_
